// be passed to the callbacks.
// These objects will created when all checks will be passed, context object
// will be created, middleware will say that all good and we can proceed,
// and in that moment executor object will be created and will be passed
// to the executor's channel.
// Then one of executor goroutine will take that object and execute it.
// See methods 'serveUpdates' and 'serveExecutors' for details.
