// FViewSuccessFinisher is the alias to function (callback) that will be called,

// FViewSuccessFinisher is the alias to function (callback), which receives
// an info of sent Telegram message (API response) and standard context object
// (TCtx) by which the sent message was created.
//
// If you need to pass your own context object (extended context),
// the signature of callback must be the same as this but you can use
// your context type (the same as the your default context -> extended context
// converter registered using TBot.ExtendContext method).
//
// For example:
// type FViewSuccessCustomFinisher func(ctx *T, err error)
//
// More info: tViewSuccessFinisher, TCtx, tSender, TBot.ExtendContext.
type FViewSuccessFinisher func(ctx *TCtx, sent *api.Message)
