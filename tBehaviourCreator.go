// 'tReger' is class that simplifies the registration of handlers for
// various events.
// So, first you calling the method with name of type of event that you
// want to register:
// 'Text' for text events, 'Button' for keyboard button, 'InlineButton'
// for callback event (button of inline keyboard) and 'Command' for
// register some command.
// You pass required arguments to one of these methods and then you
// calling 'Handler' or 'Middleware' method and pass callback which
// you want to be called for event that you specified in previous call.
// For example: 'Text().Handler(func...)'



// tBehaviourCreator tries to make a link between some events that will be 
// occurred and callback that should be called as a reaction. 
//
// When you calls Text, Button, or some other "event declaration" method,
// it creates a new tEventRegistered object, pushes it to the events field.
// Next, when you call "callback registration" method (handler or middleware),
// it links ALL accumulated events with the passed callback

// the handler (or the middleware) for text event, that will be called only
// when session type will be equal to one of 'when' types.

// each text event (regardless of session type) just do not pass anything
// as argument, pass nil or 'AnyType'.
